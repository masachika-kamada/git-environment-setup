# Git Environment Setup

This repository provides a shell script file, `setup.sh`, that can be executed to set up Git in an environment where Git setup is not yet complete (such as a new machine or a newly created Docker environment).

## Usage

```
git clone

# change user' name and email

bash setup.sh
```
